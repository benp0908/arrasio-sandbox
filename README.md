# arrasio-sandbox
A simple sandbox mode based on a sandbox id (number).

# Changes required
- Find "Sandbox" for the changes required in app.js and server.js.

# Requirements
- MODE must be set to "sandbox" in config.json file.
- Enter a number between 0 and 99999999 in "Token required." textbox before clicking on "Play" button.

# Limitations
- Leaderboard, minibosses, and bots do not work properly.
